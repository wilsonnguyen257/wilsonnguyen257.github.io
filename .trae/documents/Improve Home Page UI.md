I can improve the **Home Page** to make it more impactful and welcoming, similar to the improvements we made to the Events page.

### **Planned Improvements**

1.  **Hero Section Refresh**:
    *   **Immersive Background**: Use a more vibrant gradient or subtle animated background to draw attention immediately.
    *   **Clearer Call-to-Action**: Make the "Learn More" and "Contact Us" buttons stand out more with better contrast and hover effects.
    *   **Map Integration**: Refine the map card to float more elegantly on the side, making it feel like a premium feature rather than just an embed.

2.  **Welcome Section**:
    *   **Animated Cards**: Add subtle entrance animations to the "Faith", "Community", and "Service" cards so they slide in or fade up as the user scrolls.
    *   **Icons**: Ensure the icons (🙏, ❤️, ✨) are large and visually distinct.

3.  **"Featured Event" & "Latest Gospel"**:
    *   **Highlight Card**: Use the same modern card design from the Events page for the "Featured Event" section on the homepage. This creates consistency and looks great.
    *   **Gospel Preview**: Style the latest reflection snippets to be cleaner, perhaps with a subtle quote style or card background.

4.  **Information Section (Mass Times)**:
    *   **Clean Layout**: Organize mass times and location info into a split layout that is easy to scan at a glance.
    *   **Visual Hierarchy**: Use bold icons and clear headings so visitors find the service times instantly.

This plan focuses on **visual polish and layout optimization** within `src/pages/Home.tsx` to create a warmer, more professional first impression.
