I understand. You want to keep the focus on the **post content** (text) while having the *option* to add links/videos, without the layout treating it as a "video-only" post.

I will proceed with removing the clearly unnecessary elements to streamline your workflow:

### **1. Fix "Read more -> ->" (Double Arrow)**
*   **Action**: Remove the text arrow from the translation file so it only shows the single styled icon.

### **2. Clean up Admin Interface (Remove English Fields)**
*   **Action**: Remove the **"Title (English)"** and **"Content (English)"** input fields from the Admin page.
*   **Why**: This removes the clutter. You will only need to enter your content once (in Vietnamese). The system will automatically handle the data structure in the background.

### **3. Public Page Check**
*   **Action**: I will ensure the layout remains text-focused as you requested, with videos/links appearing neatly at the bottom or top as supplementary content, not dominating the post.

This will make the "Gospel" section and its Admin much cleaner and faster to use.
