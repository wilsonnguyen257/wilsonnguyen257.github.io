I can improve the **Events** page display by focusing on a more engaging, modern layout that highlights the upcoming events while making the list of all events easier to scan.

### **Planned Improvements**

1.  **Refine Hero Section**:
    *   Reduce the height slightly to make the first event more visible on initial load.
    *   Enhance the visual appeal of the background.

2.  **Enhance Event Cards**:
    *   **Upcoming Events**: Keep the prominent "Featured/Next Event" card but refine its typography and spacing.
    *   **Event List Grid**: Improve the grid layout for the monthly groups. Instead of just listing them, we can make the month headers stickier or more distinct.
    *   **Card Design**: Clean up the event cards in the list. Ensure the thumbnail aspect ratio is consistent and the text hierarchy (Title > Date/Time > Location) is clear.

3.  **Visual Polish**:
    *   Add subtle hover effects to cards to make them feel interactive.
    *   Improve the "Status Badges" (Upcoming/Past) to be more elegant.

4.  **Mobile Optimization**:
    *   Ensure the "Next Event" card stacks gracefully on mobile screens without taking up too much vertical space.

This plan focuses on **CSS/Tailwind adjustments** within `src/pages/Events.tsx` to elevate the visual experience without changing the underlying data structure.
